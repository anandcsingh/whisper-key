# Whisper Key

## Privacy enhanced Verifiable Credentials (VC) Hub

A platform where Verifiable Credential Issuers can create new types of credentials or reuse existing standards and issue them to owners with ease. Owners selectively disclose some or all the data in their Verifiable Credential with Verifiers via Zero Knowledge proofs while Verifiers obtain only the information needed.

## Architecture
![architecture](<docs/Whisper Key High Level.png>)

Whisper Key consists of 3 major components: a front-end for visually designing and issuing credentials. An API that generates those credentials in the form of smart contract code and dynamic interaction code. It also provides access to data stored in off-chain storage. An NPM package containing a pipeline for dynamically generating smart contracts, proxy code to dynamically invoke smart contract code and a simple off-chain storage library.

### Whisper UI

The Whisper UI application is the hub of the Whisper Key ecosystem, it allows end users to design credentials capturing the data they need and issue them directly to their customers. Whisper UI generates a form dynamically based on the design of the credential. This allows Issuers to initiate transactions to any type of credential without having to write code. The Whisper UI is currently hosted at [**https://whisper-key-ui.onrender.com/whisper-key/**](https://whisper-key-ui.onrender.com/whisper-key/), note the interactions may take a long time as contracts are being compiled on a small instance.

#### Features

* Login with Auro Wallet
* Create a new type of credential
* Issue a credential type to Owner
* View created credential types
* View your "Owned" credentials

#### Technology

* NodeJS
* NextJS
* ReactJS
* o1js

#### How to run

Set the following environment variable to point the the api. for example

`NEXT_PUBLIC_CREDENTIALS_API=http://localhost:3001/api/credentials`

Navigate to the ui folder and run the following commands

`npm install && npm run build`

`npm run start` 

### Whisper API

The Whisper API is the workhorse of the Whisper Key ecosystem. The API is currently hosted at [**https://whisper-key-api.onrender.com/**](https://whisper-key-api.onrender.com/). The API has 3 major functions

* Generate and Deploy new credential contracts based on user input
* Issue new credentials via invocations of Whisper Key deployed credential contracts
* Retrieve and send data to the off-chain storage solution ZK Mentat Store

The API supports the following endpoints

| VERB | Path                                | Description                                                  |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| POST | '/api/credentials'                  | Given a contract definition  generates and deploys a new contract based on the data |
| GET  | '/api/credentials/created/:address' | Returns all the credentials generated and deployed by a given wallet address |
| POST | '/api/credentials/issue/:name'      | Issues a new named credential to a given owner with its detail in the body of the request |
| GET  | '/api/credentials/owned/:address'   | Returns all the credentials and Owner has been issued regardless of the Issuer |

#### Technology

* NodeJS
* ExpressJS
* o1js
* ZK Mentat Store

#### How to run

Set the following environment variable to point the the api. for example

`FEE_PAYER=[Private Key of Payer]`

Navigate to the ui folder and run the following commands

`npm install && npm run build`

`npm run start`

#### Known Issues

* Currently only the  FEE_PAYER account can issue credentials, this can be fixed as we go forward. For now set the FEE_PAYER to the Issuer's Private Key
* Unable to parse signed transactions from the client at this time, verifying the data on the server was disabled, The signature is serialized by the Whisper UI and sent to the API but not used.
* Firebase SDK sometimes disconnects and the action needs to be run again

### Whisper Key Core NPM Package

The Whisper Key Core NPM Package is deployed to NPM named `contract-is-key`.  The package brings together several features of Whisper Key that each  have merit on their own. The can be independently developed in the future.

#### Credential Repository

The Credential Repository manages storing metadata about contracts and the details of issued contracts. All credential details are stored in a Firebase collection called CredentialMetadata. This store the definition of the credential data structure as well as other information. When the first credential of a certain type is issued a new collection for that type is created and managed via a Zero Knowledge Database called ZK Mentat Store

#### ZK Mentat Store

This is a simple Zero Knowledge Database that allows you to store a Merkle Map root on-chain while preserving the data in a data store of your choice. Currently the package has a Firebase backed version of the DB. But you can extend the `ZkMentatStore` abstract class to roll your own implementation. The class structure is below

`export abstract class ZkMentatStore  {`

 `async getMerkleMap(): Promise<MerkleMapState> { ... }`

 `abstract getAll(): Promise<Map<any, IEntity>>;`

 `abstract getAllHashes(): Promise<Map<any, Field>>;`

 `abstract get(key: any): Promise<IEntity | undefined | null>;`

 `abstract upsert(entity: IEntity): Promise<void>;`

 `abstract clearStore(): Promise<void>;`

`}`

#### Credential Pipeline

The credential pipeline allows you to independently create steps in processing and generating a credential. You can define a single step in its own class and add it to the pipeline. The pipeline will run the tasks in the order you specify while keeping track of important artifacts. Example usage is below

`const creds: CredentialMetadata = CredentialMetadata.fromJson(req.body);`

  `const pipeline = new CredentialGenerationPipeline();`

  `pipeline.initDefault();`

  `pipeline.addStep(new BundleFileStep());`

  `pipeline.run(creds);`

There are currently 4 implemented steps in the pipeline

1. CreateFileStep - generates a new Contract, data Struct and Proxy interactor
2. BundleFileStep - webpacks the contract and its associated code
3. StoreMetadataStep - using ZK Mentat Store for credential data storage
4. DeployContractStep - takes the newly generated contract and deploys it to Mina

#### Credential Proxy

Since the contracts we interact with are dynamic, currently only data they prove is dynamic. So we can have contracts that store different types of information We needed a uniform way to interact with any generated contract. A new Credential Proxy class is generated along with a new contract. The details of the types are hidden behind a common interface `issueCredential()`. Based on the name of the credential we want to issue a specific Credential Proxy will be loaded that knows the details of the contract and its accompanying data structure.

## Future Features

- Encrypt Owner's data such that only they can decrypt it, this was supposed to be a main feature but encountered issues using the encryption library
- Allow the Owner to choose to store their credential on their device encrypted at rest
- Allow the Issuer to directly send the deploy transaction instead of using Whisper API
- API for letting others download generated contract files (it is there now not tested @ /api/scripts/:name)
- Contemplate the usage of a Whisper Key Oracle when attempting to verify a credential

All together that's **Whisper Key** the Hub for Verifiable Credentials with enhanced privacy utilizing Mina and Zero Knowledge proofs and hopefully our entrance into the Spacing Guild ðŸ˜Ž
